% Exercise 11.5.5
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{11.5.5}
Let \(\mathbb{K}/\Bbbk\) be a Galois extension, and \(\mathbb{L}\), \(\mathbb{M}\) be intermediate fields. Denote by \(\mathbb{L}\vee \mathbb{M}\) the minimal subfield of \(\mathbb{K}\) containing 
\(\mathbb{L}\) and \(\mathbb{M}\). 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \((\mathbb{L}\cap \mathbb{M})^*=\la \mathbb{L}^*,\mathbb{M}^*\ra\).
\item \((\mathbb{L}\vee \mathbb{M})^*=\mathbb{L}^*\cap \mathbb{M}^*\).
\item Assume that \(\mathbb{L}/\Bbbk\) is normal. Then \(\Gal(\mathbb{L}\vee \mathbb{M}/\mathbb{M})\cong \Gal(\mathbb{L}/(\mathbb{L}\cap \mathbb{M}))\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item We know that \(L\cap M\subseteq L\), by the Galois correspondence, we have \(L^*\subseteq (L\cap M)^*\). Similarly, we can see that \(M^*\subseteq (L\cap M)^*\). Note that \(\la L^*, M^*\ra\) is the smallest subgroup containing \(L^*\) and \(M^*\). This implies 
\((L\cap M)^*\) contains \(\la L^*,M^*\ra\). On the other hand, suppose \(a\in \mathbb{K}\) is fixed by every element in the group \(\la L^*,M^*\ra\), so \(a\) is invariant under every element in \(L^*\) and \(M^*\). This is the same as \(a\in L\) and \(a\in M\), so \(a\in L\cap M\). This proves 
\(\la L^*,M^*\ra^*\subseteq L\cap M\), by Galois correspondence, we have \((L\cap M)^*\subseteq \la L^*,M^*\ra\). Thus, we can conclude that \((L\cap M)^*=\la L^*,M^*\ra\). 
\item By definition, we know that \(L\vee M\supseteq L\) and \(L\vee M\supseteq M\), by Galois correspondence, we have \((L\vee M)^*\subseteq L^*\) and \((L\vee M)^*\subseteq M^*\), so \((L\vee M)^*\subseteq L^*\cap M^*\). On the other hand, \(L^*\cap M^*\subseteq L^*\) and \(L^*\cap M^*\subseteq M^*\), by Galois correspondence, we have 
\((L^*\cap M^*)^*\supseteq L\) and \((L^*\cap M^*)^*\supseteq M\). Note that \(L\vee M\) is the smallest subfield containing \(L\) and \(M\), so \((L^*\cap M^*)^*\supseteq L\vee M\), by Galois correspondence, we have \(L^*\cap M^*\subseteq (L\vee M)^*\). Thus, we can conclude that \((L\vee M)^*=L^*\cap M^*\). 
\item Consider the field extension

\begin{problem}{11.5.6}
Let \(\mathbb{K}/\Bbbk\) be a finite Galois extension and \(p\) be a prime number. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \(\mathbb{K}\) has an intermediate subfield \(\mathbb{L}\) such that \([\mathbb{K}:\mathbb{L}]\) is a prime power. 
\item If \(\mathbb{L}_1\) and \(\mathbb{L_2}\) are intermediate subfields with \([\mathbb{K}:\mathbb{L}_1]\), \([\mathbb{K}:\mathbb{L}_2]\) both 
\(p\)-powers, and \([\mathbb{L}_1:\Bbbk]\), \([\mathbb{L}_2:\Bbbk]\) both prime to \(p\), then \(\mathbb{L}_1\) is \(\mathbb{L}_1\) is \(\Bbbk\)-isomorphic to \(\mathbb{L}_2\).

Let \(f\in \Bbbk[x]\), \(\mathbb{K}/\Bbbk\) be a splitting field for \(f\) over \(\Bbbk\), and \(G:=\Gal(\mathbb{K}/\Bbbk)\).
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(G\) acts on the set of the roots of \(f\).
\item \(G\) acts transitively if \(f\) is irreducible. 
\item If \(f\) has no multiple roots and \(G\) acts transitively then \(f\) is irreducible.

and \(G_\alpha\) be the set of all \(\sigma\in G\) with \(\sigma(\alpha)=\alpha\). Then: 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \([G:G_\alpha]=n\);
\item \(G_\alpha^*=\Bbbk(\alpha)\);

Then there exists an intermediate field \(\Bbbk\subseteq \mathbb{F}\subseteq \Bbbk(\alpha)\) if and only if \(\Gal(f;\Bbbk)\) is imprimitive (as a permutation group on the roots), in which case \(\mathbb{F}\) can be chosen so that 
\([\mathbb{F}:\Bbbk]\) is equal to the number of imprimitive blocks.

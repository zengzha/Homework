\begin{problem}{1}
Compute both \(\Tor_i(A,B)\) and \(\Ext^i(A,B)\) for all \(i\) in the following cases: 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \(A=\mathbb{Z}/9\) and \(B=\mathbb{Z}/6\).
\item \(A=\mathbb{Z}/9\) and \(B=\mathbb{Z}\).
\item \(A=\mathbb{Z}^2\oplus \mathbb{Z}/4\oplus \mathbb{Z}/5\oplus \mathbb{Z}/10\) and \(B=\mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}/3\oplus \mathbb{Z}/4\oplus \mathbb{Z}/6\).

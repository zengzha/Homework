\begin{problem}{1}
Write down a complete description of the homology groups of \(\Gr_3(\mathbb{C}^5)\). Determine as many intersection products between the Schubert classes \([\underline{a}]\) as you can. At least do all cases of complementary dimensions, and compute \([1,2,2]^2\) (here \(\underline{a}=(1,2,2)\) is a Schubert symbol, not a jump sequence). Try to do some others.
\end{problem} 
\begin{solution}
Let \(0\leq a_1\leq a_2\leq a_3\leq 2=5-3\) be the Schubert symbol of \(\Gr_3(\mathbb{C}^5)\). We have ten different choices and the homology groups can be summarized as follows

Next, we are going to determine the intersection product in complementary dimension. Note the cohomology ring is Abelian because we only have cohomology in even dimensions. For simplicity, I will only write the representative matrices. We always choose the first Schubert symbol in the standard flag 
\[0\subseteq \la e_1\ra\subseteq \la e_1,e_2\ra\subseteq \la e_1,e_2,e_3\ra\subseteq \la e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4\ra\subseteq \mathbb{C}^5\]
and the second Schubert symbol in the reverse flag
\[0\subseteq \la e_5\ra\subseteq \la e_4,e_5\ra\subseteq \la e_3,e_4,e_5\ra\subseteq \la e_2,e_3,e_4,e_5\ra\subseteq \mathbb{C}^5\]
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item \([0,0,1]\cdot [1,2,2]\)\\ 
\[\begin{pmatrix}
   *&0&0&0&0\\ 
   *&*&0&0&0\\
   *&*&*&*&0
\end{pmatrix}\cap \begin{pmatrix}
   0&0&0&*&*\\
   0&*&*&*&*\\ 
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
   1&0&0&0&0\\ 
   0&1&0&0&0\\ 
   0&0&0&1&0
\end{pmatrix}\]
So the intersection has only one point and \([0,0,1]\cdot [1,2,2]=[0,0,0]\).
\item \([1,1,1]\cdot [1,1,1]\)
\[\begin{pmatrix}
   *&*&0&0&0\\ 
   *&*&*&0&0\\
   *&*&*&*&0
\end{pmatrix}\cap \begin{pmatrix}
   0&0&0&*&*\\
   0&0&*&*&*\\ 
   0&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
   0&1&0&0&0\\ 
   0&0&0&1&0\\ 
   0&0&1&0&0
\end{pmatrix}\]
So the intersection has only one point and \([1,1,1]\cdot [1,1,1]=[0,0,0]\).
\item \([0,1,2]\cdot [0,1,2]\)
\[\begin{pmatrix}
   *&0&0&0&0\\ 
   *&*&*&0&0\\
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}\cap \begin{pmatrix}
   0&0&0&0&*\\
   0&0&*&*&*\\ 
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
   1&0&0&0&0\\ 
   0&0&0&0&1\\ 
   0&0&1&0&0
\end{pmatrix}\]
So the intersection has only one point and \([0,1,2]\cdot [0,1,2]=[0,0,0]\).
\item \([1,1,1]\cdot [0,1,2]\)
\[\begin{pmatrix}
   *&*&0&0&0\\ 
   *&*&*&0&0\\
   *&*&*&*&0
\end{pmatrix}\cap \begin{pmatrix}
   0&0&0&0&*\\
   0&0&*&*&*\\ 
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}\]
There does not exist a matrix satisfying the given two conditions. So the intersection has only no point and \([1,1,1]\cdot [0,1,2]=0\).
\item \([0,0,2]\cdot [0,2,2]\)
\[\begin{pmatrix}
   *&0&0&0&0\\ 
   *&*&0&0&0\\
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}\cap \begin{pmatrix}
   0&0&0&0&*\\
   0&*&*&*&*\\ 
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
   1&0&0&0&0\\ 
   0&0&0&0&1\\ 
   0&1&0&0&0
\end{pmatrix}\]
So the intersection has only one point and \([0,0,2]\cdot [0,2,2]=[0,0,0]\).
\item \([0,1,1]\cdot [0,2,2]\)
\[\begin{pmatrix}
   *&0&0&0&0\\ 
   *&*&*&0&0\\
   *&*&*&*&0
\end{pmatrix}\cap \begin{pmatrix}
   0&0&0&0&*\\
   0&*&*&*&*\\ 
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}=0\]
So the intersection has no point and \([0,1,1]\cdot [0,2,2]=0\).
\item \([0,1,1]\cdot [1,1,2]\)
\[\begin{pmatrix}
   *&0&0&0&0\\ 
   *&*&*&0&0\\
   *&*&*&*&0
\end{pmatrix}\cap \begin{pmatrix}
   0&0&0&*&*\\
   0&0&*&*&*\\ 
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}
   1&0&0&0&0\\ 
   0&0&0&1&0\\ 
   0&0&1&0&0
\end{pmatrix}\]
So the intersection has only one point and \([0,1,1]\cdot [1,1,2]=[0,0,0]\).
\item \([0,0,2]\cdot [1,1,2]\)
\[\begin{pmatrix}
   *&0&0&0&0\\ 
   *&*&0&0&0\\
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}\cap \begin{pmatrix}
   0&0&0&*&*\\
   0&0&*&*&*\\ 
   *&*&*&*&*
\end{pmatrix}=0\]
So the intersection has no point and \([0,1,1]\cdot [1,1,2]=0\).
\item In this part we will determine the intersection product \([1,2,2]^2\). Note that \([1,2,2]\in H_{10}\), so \([1,2,2]^2\in H_{10+10-12}=H_8\). Suppose 
\[[1,2,2]^2=A[0,2,2]+B[1,1,2]\]
for some \(A,B\in \mathbb{Z}\). We have 
\begin{align*}
    [1,2,2]^2[0,1,1]&=A[0,2,2][0,1,1]+B[1,1,2][0,1,1]=B,\\ 
    [1,2,2]^2[0,0,2]&=A[0,2,2][0,0,2]+B[1,1,2][0,0,2]=A.
\end{align*}
Suppose \(W\) is a \(3\)-plane in the intersection \([1,2,2]^2[0,1,1]\), note that for all the \(2\)'s in the Schubert symbol, the condition is automatically satisfied. \(W\) needs to satisfy the following condition:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \(\dim W\cap F_2\geq 1\) for some \(2\)-plane \(F_2\). 
\item \(\dim W\cap F'_2\geq 1\) for some \(2\)-plane \(F'_2\).
\item \(\dim W\cap F'_1\geq 1\) for some \(1\)-line \(F''_1\).
\item \(\dim W\cap F'_3\geq 2\) for some \(3\)-plane \(F''_3\).
\item \(\dim W\cap F'_4\geq 3\) for some \(4\)-plane \(F''_4\).
\end{enumerate}
Here \(F''_1\subseteq F''_3\subseteq F''_4\). The condition (iii) implies \(W\) contains a vector \(e_1\) where \(\la e_1\ra=F''_1\).  The condition (v) implies that \(W\) is contained in a \(4\)-plane \(F''_4\). For any generic \(3\)-plane \(F''_3\subseteq F''_4\), we have 
\[\dim W\cap F''_3=\dim W+\dim F''_3-\dim F''_4=3+3-4=2.\]
This implies that the condition (iv) is automatically satisfied. 
\end{enumerate}
We can see that \(W\) is uniquely determined by three lines: \(F''_1\), \(W\cap F_2\), \(W\cap F'_2\). Thus, \(B=1\). 

On the other hand, suppose \(W\) is a \(3\)-plane in the intersection \([1,2,2]^2[0,0,2]\). \(W\) needs to satisfy the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \(\dim W\cap F_2\geq 1\) for some \(2\)-plane \(F_2\). 
\item \(\dim W\cap F'_2\geq 1\) for some \(2\)-plane \(F'_2\).
\item \(\dim W\cap F''_1\geq 1\) for some \(1\)-line \(F''_1\).
\item \(\dim W\cap F''_2\geq 2\) for some \(2\)-plane \(F''_2\). 
\end{enumerate}
The condition (iv) implies that \(W\) contains a \(2\)-plane \(F''_2\), and the condition (iii) is automatically true because \(F''_1\subseteq F''_2\). If \(F_2\) intersects with \(F'_2\), then \(W\) is uniquely determined by \(F_2\cap F'_2\) and \(F''_2\). If \(F_2\) has no intersection with \(F'_2\), in this case one of them must intersect \(F''_2\) because we are in \(\mathbb{C}^5\), suppose it is \(F_2\), then \(\dim W\cap F_2\geq 1\) is automatically satisfied, this means \(W\) is uniquely determined by \(F''_2\) and \(W\cap F'_2\). In both cases, \(W\) is unique. Thus, \(A=1\).

We can conclude that \([1,2,2]^2=[0,2,2]+[1,1,2]\).

% Problem 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{2}
Compute \(H_*(\Omega_{\underline{a}})\) where \(\underline{a}\) is the Schubert symbol \(012\), and \(\Omega_{\underline{a}}\hookrightarrow \Gr_3(\mathbb{C}^5)\). Observe that \(\Omega_{\underline{a}}\) cannot be a manifold, as this would violate Poincaré Duality.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
From the cellular structure of \(\Gr_3(\mathbb{C}^5)\), we know that \(\Omega_{\underline{a}}\)is of dimension \(6\), and has \(2\) 4-dimensional cells \([0,1,1]\) and \([0,0,2]\), but only \(1\) 2-dimensional cell \([0,0,1]\). If \(\Omega_{\overline{a}}\) is a manifold, then this will violate Poincaré duality as \(H_2\) and \(H_4\) have different ranks.
\end{solution}

% Problem 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{3}
Fix \(n\geq 1\) and \(k\leq n\). Let \(\eta_k\subseteq \Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^n)\times \mathbb{R}^n\) be the subspace of pairs \((W,v)\) where \(v\in W\). Let \(p:\eta_K\rightarrow \Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^n)\) be the map sending \((W,v)\) to \(W\). Prove that \(p\) is a fiber bundle with fiber \(\mathbb{R}^k\). 
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
Given any \(k\)-plane \(W\in \Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^n)\), we can view \(W\) as a \(k\times n\) matrix, where each row in this matrix is a basis of the \(k\)-plane \(W\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). Without loss of generality, we may assume the \(k\times k\)-minor from the first \(k\) columns is non-degenerate. In this case, we can choose the basis of \(W\) in the following way such that \(W\) can be viewed as a matrix 
\[W=\left[ \begin{array}{c|c}
   I_k & A
\end{array} \right]\]
Consider the following subset \(U\subseteq \Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^n)\): if we view \(k\)-planes as \(k\times n\) matrix, then the set \(U\) is the set of all \(k\)-planes \(V\in \Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^n)\) satisfying the first \(k\times k\)-minor is non-degenerate. Equivalently, \(U\) is the following set 
\[U=\left\{ V\in \Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^n)\mid V=\left[  \begin{array}{c|c}
    I_k & A
\end{array}\right]\ \text{where}\ A\in M_{k\times (n-k)}(\mathbb{R}) \right\}\cong \mathbb{R}^{k(n-k)}.\]
We need to construct a homeomorphism \(p^{-1}(U)\cong U\times \mathbb{R}^k\). For any \((V,v)\in p^{-1}(U)\), the matrix form gives a basis of \(V\)
\begin{align*}
   &v_1=(1,0,\ldots,0,*,\ldots,*)\\ 
   &v_2=(0,1,\ldots,0,*,\ldots,*)\\
   &\cdots\\ 
   &v_k=(0,0,\ldots,1,*,\ldots,*)
\end{align*}
\(v\) can be written uniquely as 
\[v=a_1v_1+\cdots+a_kv_k\]
for some \(a_1,\ldots,a_k\in \mathbb{R}\). Define the map 
\begin{align*}
   f:p^{-1}(U)&\rightarrow U\times \mathbb{R}^k,\\ 
     (V,v)&\mapsto (V,(a_1,\ldots,a_k))
\end{align*}
Conversely, given any \((a_1,\ldots, a_k)\in \mathbb{R}^k\), there exists 
\[v=a_1v_1+\cdots+a_kv_k\in V.\]
This gives an inverse map \(f^{-1}:U\times \mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow p^{-1}(U)\). It is easy to see that \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\) are compatible with the projection map, and it remains to prove both \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\) are continuous. Consider the following commutative diagram 
% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMyxbMCwwLCJwXnstMX0oVSkiXSxbMCwxLCJcXHRleHR7R3J9X2soXFxtYXRoYmJ7Un1ebilcXHRpbWVzIFxcbWF0aGJie1J9Xm4iXSxbMSwwLCJVXFx0aW1lcyBcXG1hdGhiYntSfV5rIl0sWzAsMiwiZiJdLFswLDEsIiIsMix7InN0eWxlIjp7InRhaWwiOnsibmFtZSI6Im1vbm8ifX19XSxbMSwyLCJcXHRpbGRle2Z9IiwyXV0=
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{p^{-1}(U)} & {U\times \mathbb{R}^k} \\
	{\text{Gr}_k(\mathbb{R}^n)\times \mathbb{R}^n}
	\arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[tail, from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow["{\tilde{f}}"', from=1-2, to=2-1]
\end{tikzcd}\]
The map 
\[\tilde{f}:U\times \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^n)\times \mathbb{R}^k\] 
is sending \(V\) to \(V\) and \((a_1,\ldots, a_k)\) to \(v\in V\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\). Under the basis we choose previously, we can write 
\begin{align*}
   v=&\quad a_1v_1+\cdots+a_kv_k\\ 
    =&\quad a_1(1,0,\ldots,0,*,\ldots,*)\\ 
     &+a_2(0,1,\ldots,0,*,\ldots,*)\\
     &+\cdots\\ 
     &+a_k(0,0,\ldots,1,*,\ldots,*)\\ 
    =&(a_1,\ldots,a_k,*,\ldots,*) 
\end{align*}
So the map \(\tilde{f}\) is just a inclusion map from \(\mathbb{R}^k\) to \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and thus is an open map and continuous. The composition 
\[\tilde{f}\circ f:p^{-1}(U)\rightarrow \Gr_k(\mathbb{R}^n)\times \mathbb{R}^n\]
is also an inclusion map and continous, so \(f\) is continuous. Similarly, consider the commutative diagram 
% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsMyxbMCwwLCJVXFx0aW1lcyBcXG1hdGhiYntSfV5rIl0sWzEsMCwicF57LTF9KFUpIl0sWzEsMSwiXFx0ZXh0e0dyfV9rKFxcbWF0aGJie1J9Xm4pXFx0aW1lcyBcXG1hdGhiYntSfV5uIl0sWzEsMiwiIiwyLHsic3R5bGUiOnsidGFpbCI6eyJuYW1lIjoibW9ubyJ9fX1dLFswLDIsIlxcd2lkZXRpbGRle2Zeey0xfX0iLDJdLFswLDEsImZeey0xfSJdXQ==
\[\begin{tikzcd}

	\arrow["{\widetilde{f^{-1}}}"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[tail, from=1-2, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
The same argument implies that the map \(\widetilde{f^{-1}}\) is an inclusion, and thus continuous. The right vertical map is an inclusion of open set, so it is an open map. This implies \(f^{-1}\) is also continous. 
\end{solution}

% Problem 4
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{problem}{4}
Let \(q:X\rightarrow Q\) be a surjection. Say that a map of spaces \(f:X\rightarrow Z\) is "q-compatible" if whenever \(q(x)=q(y)\) we have \(f(x)=f(y)\) (this says that the identifications made by \(q\) are also made by \(f\)). The map \(q\) is a quotient map if and only if for every space \(Z\) and every map \(f:X\rightarrow Z\) that is \(q\)-compatible, there is a map \(\tilde{f}:Q\rightarrow Z\) such that \(\tilde{f}\circ q=f\). 

Prove that if \(q:X\rightarrow Q\) is a quotient map and \(A\) is locally compact and Hausdoff, then 
\[q\times id:X\times A\rightarrow Q\times A\]
 is also a quotient map.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
Let \(Z\) be any space and \(f:X\times A\rightarrow Z\) be a \((q\times id)\)-compatible map, namely for all \(a\in A\), if \((q\times id)(x,a)=(q\times id)(y,a)\) for some \(x,y\in X\), then \(f(x,a)=f(y,a)\in Z\). Note that \(A\) is locally compact and Hausdoff, we have a bijection
\[\mathcal{Top}(X\times A,Z)\cong \mathcal{Top}(X,Z^A).\]
The map \(f\) is equivalent to a continuous map \(g:X\rightarrow Z^A\) sending \(x\in X\) to the map \(a\mapsto f(x,a)\). We claim that the map \(g\) is \(q\)-compatible. Indeed, suppose \(q(x)=q(y)\) for some \(x,y\in X\), then \((q\times id)(x,a)=(q\times id)(y,a)\) for all \(a\in A\). Since the map \(f\) is \((q\times id)\)-compatible, we have \(f(x,a)=f(y,a)\) for all \(a\in A\). This implies the two maps \(a\mapsto f(x,a)\) and \(a\mapsto f(y,a)\) are the same map. So \(g\) is \(q\)-compatible. We know that \(q:X\rightarrow Q\) is a quotient map, so there exists \(\tilde{g}:Q\rightarrow Z^A\) such that \(\tilde{g}\circ q=g\).

The map \(\tilde{g}:Q\rightarrow Z^A\) is equivalent to a continuous map \(\tilde{f}:Q\times A\rightarrow Z\) sending \((p,a)\in Q\times A\) to \(\tilde{g}(p)(a)\). We check that \(\tilde{f}\circ (q\times id)=f\), namely the following diagram commutes.

	\arrow["{\tilde{f}}"', from=2-1, to=1-2]
\end{tikzcd}\] 
For any \((x,a)\in X\times A\), we have 
\[(\tilde{f}\circ (q\times id))(x,a)=\tilde{f}(q(x),a)=\tilde{g}(q(x))(a)=(\tilde{g}\circ q)(x)(a)=g(x)(a).\]
Note that \(g(x)\) is an element in \(Z^A\), and \(g(x)(a)=f(x,a)\in Z\) because \(f\) and \(g\) is equivalent under the bijection 
\[\mathcal{Top}(X\times A,Z)\cong \mathcal{Top}(X,Z^A).\]
This proves that the diagram commutes and \(q\times id\) is a quotient map.

Let \((X,x)\) be a pointed space. Recall that \(PX\subseteq X'\) is the subspace of paths that end at \(x\). Said differently, \(PX\) is defined by the pullback diagram

Convince yourself that maps \(W\rightarrow PX\) are in bijective correspondence with maps \(CW\rightarrow X\) sending the cone point to \(x\) (here \(CW\) is the cone on W). 

If \(A\) is a CW-complex, prove that \(ev_0:PX\rightarrow X\) has the homotopy lifting property with respect to \(A\). In particular, the fact that this holds whenever \(A\) is \(I^n\) (any \(n\geq 0\)) implies that \(PX\rightarrow X\) is a Serre fibration.

For all \(a\in A\), the map \(f:A\times \left\{ 0 \right\}\rightarrow PX\) sends \(a\) to a path \(f(a):I\rightarrow X\). This is equivalent to a map \(\tilde{f}:CA\times \left\{ 0 \right\}\rightarrow X\) sending \((a,t)\) to \(f(a)(t)\). This is well-defined because all different paths ends at the same point \(x\in X\). We know that \(A\) is a CW complex, so \(A\times I\) and \(C(A\times I)\) are also CW complexes, and \(A\times I\) and \(C(A\times \left\{ 0 \right\})\) are subcomplexes of \(C(A\times I)\). The inclusion of the subcomplex
\[C(A\times \left\{ 0 \right\})\cup A\times I\rightarrow C(A\times I)\]
is a homotopy equivalence because \(A\times I\) is homotopy equivalent to \(A\times \left\{ 0 \right\}\subseteq C(A\times \left\{ 0 \right\})\), and both cones are contractible. 
Consider the solid-arrow diagram

\(\tilde{f}\) restricting to \(A\times \left\{ 0 \right\}\) can be viewed as the composition of the map 
\[A\times \left\{ 0 \right\}\xrightarrow{f}PX\xrightarrow{ev_0}X.\]
By commutativity of the original diagram, this is equal to the map 
\[g|_{A\times \left\{ 0 \right\}}:A\times \left\{ 0 \right\}\rightarrow X.\]
By GLP, we have a lifting \(F:C(A\times I)\rightarrow X\) such that \(F|_{C(A\times \left\{ 0 \right\})}=\tilde{f}\) and \(F|_{A\times I}=g\). We know that \(F\) is equivalent to a map \(\tilde{F}:A\times I\rightarrow PX\) satisfying the following two diagrams

	\arrow["{\tilde{F}}", from=2-3, to=1-4]
	\arrow["g"', from=2-3, to=2-4]
\end{tikzcd}\]
This proves that original diagram has a lifting. Thus, we can conclude that \(ev_0:PX\rightarrow X\) has the homotopy lifting property with respect to any CW complex A.
